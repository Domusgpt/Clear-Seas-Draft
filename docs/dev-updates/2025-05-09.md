# Dev Update â€“ 2025-05-09

## What Changed
1. **Rebranded the documentation layer as the CSS Web Master system.** Updated `README.md` to describe the initiative, emphasize the multi-site goal, and map the current collections.
2. **Contextualized the HTML manifest.** Refreshed `docs/html-version-groups.md` with CSS Web Master framing, added links to dev updates, and documented a generalization watchlist that flags Clear Seas specific assumptions.
3. **Authored a platform overview.** Added `docs/css-web-master-system.md` to explain the runtime architecture, asset flow, onboarding steps for new sites, and outstanding work.
4. **Established a Dev Updates log.** Created the `docs/dev-updates/` directory to chronicle future iterations and provide stakeholders with rationale for each change set.

## Why It Matters
- Moves the project narrative beyond a single Clear Seas showcase and toward a reusable control hub for the wider CSS web family.
- Highlights areas that still need abstraction (copy, assets, deployment) before shipping to other domains.
- Gives designers, developers, and stakeholders a clear entry point for understanding how the motion orchestration, asset registries, and style systems cooperate.

## Follow-Up Actions
- Extract site configuration (palettes, asset rotations) into portable JSON files.
- Draft onboarding playbooks for paraerator.com and vib3code.com referencing the new overview document.
- Evaluate automation options for smoke testing motion synchrony across the most popular builds.
