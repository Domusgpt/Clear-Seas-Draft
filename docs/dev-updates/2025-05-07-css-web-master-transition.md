# Dev Update â€“ 7 May 2025

## What changed

- Reframed the repository as the **CSS-Web-Master** platform in `README.md`, clarifying how the existing Clear Seas Draft builds
  seed future CSS-family launches.
- Authored the **CSS-Web-Master System Overview** documenting the orchestration layers, workflow, and asset strategy for
  multi-site reuse.
- Captured a **Gap Analysis** outlining Clear Seas-specific assumptions that need generalization before deploying to
  paraerator.com, vib3code.com, or other destinations.

## Why it matters

- Teams now have a single source of truth that explains how to extend the orchestrator, card systems, and synergy styles beyond
  the Clear Seas showcase.
- The gap analysis exposes remaining work (naming, asset manifests, styling extractions) so follow-up sprints can target the
  highest-impact refactors.

## Next recommendations

1. Prototype a new page profile (e.g., `paraerator`) in `scripts/page-profile-registry.js` to validate the workflow and confirm
   asset overrides behave as expected.
2. Introduce namespace aliases for the global motion object/event to decouple future builds from the `clear-seas` prefix.
3. Begin extracting neutral typography and color tokens into a shared variables file so each site can ship with its own brand
   skin while reusing the same motion choreography.
