# HTML Audit Report – 8 May 2025

This report captures structural and accessibility observations for every HTML document in the repository. Findings are organized in batches so recurring issues can be addressed systematically.

## Batch A – Control Surface Index Library

### index.html
- Missing `<meta name="description">`, so search engines receive no summary for the control surface hub. The `<head>` only declares charset, viewport, title, and inline styles. 
- No `<main>` landmark wraps the primary content; everything lives inside a generic `.container` div, which reduces screen reader navigation fidelity.
- No top-level `<h1>` heading is present, so the page lacks a semantic entry point for assistive technology.
- Relies on a large inline `<style>` block for layout and theming, hindering caching and maintainability.

### 1-index.html
- Missing `<meta name="description">` in the `<head>`.
- No `<main>` region; layout starts immediately inside `<body>` containers.
- Multiple inline `<style>` blocks drive the experience, fragmenting CSS concerns.

### 2-index-optimized.html
- Omits a `<main>` landmark even though the layout is otherwise semantic (`<header>`, `<section>`, etc.).

### 3-index-fixed.html
- Missing `<meta name="description">` in the document head.
- No `<main>` landmark around the central content.
- Loads `scripts/polytopal-reactivity-json.js` without `defer`/`async`, which blocks rendering during download.

### 4-index-unified.html
- Missing `<meta name="description">`.
- No `<main>` wrapper for the core content blocks.
- Two external scripts (`scripts/polytopal-reactivity-json.js` and `scripts/preset-laboratory.js`) load without `defer`/`async`, creating render-blocking requests.

### 5-index-vib34d-integrated.html
- Missing `<meta name="description">`.
- No `<main>` landmark around the stacked sections.
- Uses a monolithic inline `<style>` block for all presentation, making reuse and caching difficult.

### 6-index-totalistic.html
- Missing `<meta name="description">`.
- No `<main>` landmark groups the principal layout grid.
- Inline `<style>` block in the head drives all design tokens and layout rules.
- `scripts/polytopal-reactivity-json.js` is referenced without `defer`/`async`, blocking hydration.

## Batch B – Preview Release (PR) Experiences

### 7-pr-1.html → 12-pr-6.html
- No critical structural issues noted in this pass; each file includes a meta description, `<main>` landmark, and `<h1>` heading.

### 13-pr-7.html
- Lacks `<meta name="description">`, so the neon gallery cannot publish a summary to search engines.
- No `<main>` element is provided, leaving the scrolling region un-landmarked.
- Does not include an `<h1>` heading; the layout jumps straight into decorative sections.
- Ships an extensive inline `<style>` block that contains both resets and component rules.

### 14-pr-8.html → 30-pr-24.html
- No significant structural defects observed; meta descriptions, `<main>` landmarks, and `<h1>` headings are present across these preview releases.

## Batch C – Specialty & Legacy Layouts

### 25-orthogonal-depth-progression.html
- Missing `<meta name="description">`.
- No `<main>` wrapper for the primary narrative column.
- No `<h1>` heading anchors the content hierarchy.
- All layout and effects are authored in a single inline `<style>` block.
- Buttons rely on inline `onclick` attributes plus an inline `<script>` block for initialization, which couples behavior to markup.

### ULTIMATE-clear-seas-holistic-system.html
- Missing `<meta name="description">`.
- No `<main>` landmark is defined.
- Relies on a full inline `<style>` block for layout and animation, limiting reuse.

### parserator.html
- Missing `<meta name="description">` in the `<head>`.
- Heavy inline `<style>` block powers the entire grid layout; consider extracting to a stylesheet for caching and reuse.
