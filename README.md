üåê **CSS-Web-Master System** _(formerly the Clear Seas Draft showcase)_

The repository now serves as the **CSS-Web-Master** control surface for the Clear Seas family of properties. It retains every
historical Clear Seas Draft experience while layering documentation, orchestration guides, and asset registries so new landing
pages‚Äîlike **parserator.com**, **vib3code.com**, and future CSS destinations‚Äîcan inherit the same choreography with minimal
duplication.

Runtime globals now expose both `__CSS_WEB_MASTER_*` and legacy `__CLEAR_SEAS_*` namespaces, and shared typography/color tokens
live in `styles/css-web-master-tokens.css` so each property can reskin the choreography without forking the master styles.
Brand asset rotations are sourced from `scripts/site-asset-manifest.js`, and teams can call
`window.__CSS_WEB_MASTER_REGISTER_ASSET_MANIFEST` to swap media packs per property without touching the orchestrator core.

### ‚úÖ Deployment Snapshot
- **6 Main HTML Versions**: Baseline production-ready experiences.
- **Parserator Launch Surface**: `parserator.html` boots the `parserator-alpha` profile with CSS-Web-Master orchestration.
- **13 PR Branch Versions**: Themed explorations sourced from the showcase (PRs #1, #4‚Äì#24).
- **Supporting Assets**: Shared scripts, orchestrators, style systems, and uploaded video/logo packs.

### üéØ Access Everything
Use the **[Master Index](https://domusgpt.github.io/Clear-Seas-Draft/)** to browse every build. The index now highlights where
modules overlap so you can pick the correct starting point for each CSS family site.

### üöÄ Deploying from GitHub Pages
1. Push the latest `work` branch to GitHub.
2. In the repository settings, open **Pages** ‚Üí **Build and deployment** and choose **Deploy from a branch**.
3. Select the `work` branch and the **/** (root) directory, then save.
4. After GitHub Pages finishes building, the published site will mirror this repository's root‚Äî`index.html`, `parserator.html`,
   the Master Index, and every supporting asset will be available under the Pages hostname.
5. Re-run the smoke tests (`python tests/html_smoke_test.py`) after major updates so the latest report reflects the live Pages
   deployment gaps.
