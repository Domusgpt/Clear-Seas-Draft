üåê **CSS-Web-Master System** _(formerly the Clear Seas Draft showcase)_

The repository now serves as the **CSS-Web-Master** control surface for the Clear Seas family of properties. It retains every
historical Clear Seas Draft experience while layering documentation, orchestration guides, and asset registries so new landing
pages‚Äîlike **paraerator.com**, **vib3code.com**, and future CSS destinations‚Äîcan inherit the same choreography with minimal
duplication.

### ‚úÖ Deployment Snapshot
- **6 Main HTML Versions**: Baseline production-ready experiences.
- **13 PR Branch Versions**: Themed explorations sourced from the showcase (PRs #1, #4‚Äì#24).
- **Total**: 19+ HTML builds ready to be remixed into site-specific stacks.
- **Supporting Assets**: Shared scripts, orchestrators, style systems, and uploaded video/logo packs.

### üéØ Access Everything
Use the **[Master Index](https://domusgpt.github.io/Clear-Seas-Draft/)** to browse every build. The index now highlights where
modules overlap so you can pick the correct starting point for each CSS family site.
